I want to live in a world where we focus more on the function of the body than the aesthetic. Our eyes exist for us to see, and our noses exist for us to breathe. I hope we all become free from the media that tells us to continuously abuse our bodies to fit a certain ideal. Let's aim for real power and strength instead.
