1. I want beauty to be based on human existence, free from sex appeal. It should not include our outward appearances. 
2. During ovulation, our skin becomes clearer and our cheeks turn rosy. Similarly, we put on makeup to make our skin flawless and color our cheeks and lips red. Why are we trying to look like ourselves during ovulation all the time?
